# CSCI-2910_Lab5
Lab 5 - Using Web APIs
`JSON Deserialization`: The API did not return the JSON file into a string; rather, calling on the API returns a Key-Value Pair. As such, I had to parse my JSON files into a dictionary.
`Attributes:` The listed fields in the documentation did not match up with the fields in the JSON files; as such, I had to manually look through the files in order to implement the correct attributes in my C# classes.
